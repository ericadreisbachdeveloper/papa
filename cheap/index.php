        <p class="p">If you want a site that looks great and costs less than a semester of community college, try a SquareSpace or Wordpress Themeforest template. If you need help setting those up, try searching for freelancers on&nbsp;Upwork. </p>

        <p class="p">Don't you dare use my site's contact form asking me for the web address of any of the things I just mentioned! Ask Uncle&nbsp;Google&nbsp;instead. </p>

        <p class="p">Web developers are like used cars: you generally get what you pay for, and if you're unlucky you might get much less than what you pay&nbsp;for. </p>

        <p class="p">But if you go into the process choosing cheapness over quality, then you actively court being broke down on the highway in the middle of the night with a dead cell phone, thinking, &ldquo;maaaaaaaan, it's taken <em>two months</em> for the developer to get back to my last email, and we're now nine months past our original launch date, and there are still tons of bugs to fix&nbsp;&hellip; this is super&nbsp;stressful!!&rdquo; </p>

        <p class="p">And you'll think back to this moment, and say to yourself, &ldquo;I wish now I'd looked for a good developer instead of a cheap&nbsp;developer.&rdquo; </p>
