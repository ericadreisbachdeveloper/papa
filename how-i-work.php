    <p class="p -q">What's your process? </p>
    <p class="p -a">I like to have at least one initial meeting with clients to talk in-depth about the site: technical needs, design aesthetic, content generation or migration, budget constraints&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

    <p class="p -a">From these conversations I create a milestone and delivery schedule, as well as an estimate that then becomes a soft cap on hoursâ€”with the understanding that if I run into challenges or if the spec changes along the way we'll adjust as&nbsp;needed. </p>
    <p class="p -a">Nearly all of my projects come in on time and under budget. I work hard to keep it that&nbsp;way! </p>

  <div class="page-text wrapper -narrowcol process">
    <p class="p -q">Who are your clients? </p>
    <p class="p -a">All sorts! I've produced work for large companies, nonprofits, small shops, solo practioners, bloggers, and&nbsp;more. </p>

    <p class="p -q">How long will it take? How much will it&nbsp;cost? </p>
    <p class="p -a">This varies <strong><em>a lot</em></strong>. If budget is a major constraint, know that many projects are best served with a high&nbsp;quality low&nbsp;cost <a href="http://www.squarespace.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SquareSpace</a> template. </p>

    <p class="p -q">Are you available to maintain sites long&#8209;term or work on&nbsp;retainer? </p>
    <p class="p -a">Generally I'm only available on a project basis, but that's flexible depending on the client and how well we work&nbsp;together. </p>

    <p class="p -q">What are your specialties? </p>
    <p class="p -a">Most of my sites are built with Wordpres and Bootstrap. My sweet spot is front&nbsp;end development (HTML, CSS, jQuery)&nbsp;&mdash; as opposed to graphic&nbsp;design or back&nbsp;end programming. I'm expert at turning a PSD into working&nbsp;code. </p>

    <p class="p -q">What's your background? </p>
    <p class="p -a">I grew up in northeastern Vermont (the Northeast&nbsp;Kingdom). After college I had a five&#8209;year mini&#8209;career in marketing for nonprofits that plan conferences for socially responsible business&nbsp;leaders*. <br />
    <span class="-small">*think: Ben from Ben&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Jerry's, Tom from Tom's&nbsp;of&nbsp;Maine </span> </p>

    <p class="p -a">Eventually I was more focused on hacking around on the website and coding the monthly enewsletter than on messaging and branding and other important marketing&nbsp;things. </p>

    <p class="p -a">Since 2009 I've been a full time freelance coder&#8209;designer&#8209;developer, with a short stint in 2010 writing <a href="http://www.seogonewild.tumblr.com" target="_blank">SEO&nbsp;blogs</a>. In January 2016 I incorporated as <a href="http://www.darkblackllc.com" target="_blank">Dark&nbsp;Black&nbsp;LLC</a>. </p>

    <p class="p -q">What do you post on Twitter? </p>
    <p class="p -a">Follow <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ericadreisbach" target="_blank">@ericadreisbach</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/darkblackllc" target="_blank">@darkblackllc</a> on Twitter where I post my favorite web design links and resources! Check it out if you're interested. Also, if you follow me on Twitter, then unlike Spinoza's twitter, I will follow you&nbsp;back. </p>

    <p class="p -q">What's the best way to get in touch? </p>
    <p class="p -a"><a href="./#contact">I love email</a>. You may have once heard an oracle tell of true-hearted web developers that maintain an empty inbox. I am one of whom the oracle spake. </p>

    <p class="p -a">You can expect an email reply within an hour during Central business hours, and usually within more like 20 minutes. I'm also open and flexible about making appointments for real&#8209;time&nbsp;conversation. </p>

    <p class="p -a">My favorite attachments from clients are PDFs and screenshots (jpg or png). My least favorites are Microsoft Word&reg; docx or PowerPoint&reg;&nbsp;pptx. </p>
