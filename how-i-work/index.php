          <p class="p q">What's your process? </p>
          <p class="p">I schedule at least one initial meeting with clients to talk in-depth about the site: technical needs, design aesthetic, content generation or migration, budget constraints&nbsp;&amp;c. </p>
          <p class="p">From these conversations I create a milestone and delivery schedule, as well as an estimate that then becomes a soft cap on hours&nbsp;&mdash; with the understanding that if I run into challenges or if the spec changes along the way we'll adjust as&nbsp;needed. </p>
          <p class="p">Nearly all of my projects come in on time and under budget. I work hard to keep it that&nbsp;way! </p>

        <div class="qna">
          <p class="p q">Who are your clients? </p>
          <p class="p">All sorts! I've produced work for large companies, nonprofits, small shops, solo practioners, bloggers, and&nbsp;more. </p>
        </div><!-- /.qna -->

        <div class="qna">
          <p class="p q">How long will it take? How much will it&nbsp;cost? </p>
          <p class="p">This varies a lot. If budget is a major constraint, know that many projects are best served with a high quality low cost SquareSpace&nbsp;template. </p>
        </div><!-- /.qna -->

        <div class="qna">
          <p class="p q">Are you available to maintain sites long‑term or work on&nbsp;retainer? </p>
          <p class="p">Generally I'm only available on a project basis, but that's flexible depending on the client and how well we work&nbsp;together. </p>
        </div><!-- /.qna -->

        <div class="qna">
          <p class="p q">What are your specialties? </p>
          <p class="p">Most of my sites are built with Wordpres and Bootstrap. My sweet spot is front end development (HTML, CSS, jQuery)&nbsp;&mdash; as opposed to graphic design or back end programming. I'm expert at turning a PSD into working&nbsp;code. </p>
        </div><!-- /.qna -->

        <div class="qna">
          <p class="p q">What's your background? </p>
          <p class="p">I grew up in northeastern Vermont (the Northeast Kingdom). After college I had a five‑year mini‑career in marketing for nonprofits that plan conferences for socially responsible business&nbsp;leaders*. <br />
          <span class="-small">*think: Ben from Ben &amp; Jerry's, Tom from Tom's of Maine </span></p>
          <p class="p">Eventually I was more focused on hacking around on the website and coding the monthly enewsletter than on messaging and branding and other important marketing&nbsp;things. </p>
          <p class="p">Since 2009 I've been a full time freelance coder‑designer‑developer, with a short stint in 2010 writing SEO blogs. In January 2016 I incorporated as <a href="http://www.darkblackllc.com" target="_blank" title="Erica Dreisbach | Dark Black LLC" class="a">Dark Black LLC</a>. </p>

        <div class="qna">
          <p class="p q">What do you post on Twitter? </p>
          <p class="p">Follow <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ericadreisbach" target="_blank" class="a">@ericadreisbach</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/darkblackllc" target="_blank" class="a">@darkblackllc</a> on Twitter where I post my favorite web design links and resources! Check it out if you're interested. Also, if you follow me on Twitter, then unlike Spinoza's twitter, I will follow you&nbsp;back. </p>

        <div class="qna">
          <p class="p q">What's the best way to get in&nbsp;touch? </p>
          <p class="p">I love email. You may have once heard an oracle tell of true&#8209;hearted web developers that maintain an empty inbox. I am one of whom the oracle&nbsp;spake. </p>
          <p class="p">You can expect an email reply within an hour during Central business hours, and usually within more like 20 minutes. I'm also open and flexible about making appointments for real&#8209;time&nbsp;conversation. </p>
          <p class="p">My favorite attachments from clients are PDFs and screenshots (jpg or png). My least favorites are Microsoft&nbsp;Word&reg;&nbsp;docx or PowerPoint&reg;&nbsp;pptx. </p>
