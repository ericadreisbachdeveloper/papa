          <p class="p q">How long will it take? How much will it&nbsp;cost? </p>
          <p class="p">It varies a lot, but most of the sites I build take <span class="nowrap">6-10 weeks</span> from kickoff to launch and cost more than $3,000. All of the sites featured on <a href="../#work" class="a">my&nbsp;portfolio</a> fit that&nbsp;description. </p>

          <p class="p">Occasionally I'm available for smaller projects, but that's&nbsp;rare. If budget is a major constraint, know that many sites are best served with a <span class="nowrap">high-quality</span> <span class="nowrap">low-cost</span> SquareSpace&nbsp;template. And on that note, here is some <a href="../cheap" class="a">free&nbsp;advice</a>.</p>

        <div class="qna">
          <p class="p q">What's your process? </p>
          <p class="p">I schedule at least one initial meeting with clients to talk in-depth about the site: technical needs, design aesthetic, content generation or migration, budget constraints&nbsp;&amp;c. </p>
          <p class="p">From these conversations I create a milestone and delivery schedule, as well as an estimate that then becomes a soft cap on hours&nbsp;&mdash; with the understanding that if I run into challenges or if the spec changes along the way we'll adjust as&nbsp;needed. </p>
          <p class="p">Nearly all of my projects come in on time and under budget. I work hard to keep it that&nbsp;way! </p>

        <div class="qna">
          <p class="p q">Do you do design? </p>
          <p class="p">Design is available for <span class="nowrap">laid-back</span> clients. Examples of my designs&nbsp;include </p>
          <ul class="p">
            <li><a href="https://ericadreisbach.com/" title="erica dreisbach | web designer" class="a">ericadreisbach.com</a> </li>

          </ul>

          <p class="p">I'm fluent in the full Adobe Creative Suite and am just as versatile making adjustments to a PSD as I am updating&nbsp;code. </p>

          <p class="p">That said, I work with existing graphic and UI design for the majority of my&nbsp;projects. </p>

        <div class="qna">
          <p class="p q">Will you tutor me in how to build a&nbsp;website? </p>
          <p class="p">No. </p>

        <div class="qna">
          <p class="p q">Will you tutor me if I'm super <span class="nowrap">laid-back?</span> </p>
          <p class="p">The beauty of Wordpress and SquareSpace is that the answer to every question you'll ever have is available via Google. There are also countless YouTube tutorials and PDF explainers. There are also neighborhood children who would be delighted to instruct&nbsp;you. </p>
          <p class="p">If you've never managed a website before, I recommend getting a free Wordpress blog and publishing a few posts. The interface for a site managed by Wordpress software is the same as the interface for a free Wordpress&nbsp;blog. You'll learn a lot all by&nbsp;yourself! </p>
        </div><!-- /.qna -->



        <div class="qna">
          <p class="p q">Who are your clients? </p>
          <p class="p">All sorts. I've produced work for large companies, tech startups, nonprofits, small businesses, bloggers, and&nbsp;more. </p>
        </div><!-- /.qna -->

        <div class="qna">
          <p class="p q">Are you available to maintain sites <span class="nowrap">long-term</span> or work on&nbsp;retainer? </p>
          <p class="p">Generally I'm only available on a project basis, but that's flexible depending on the client and how well we work&nbsp;together. </p>
        </div><!-- /.qna -->

        <div class="qna">
          <p class="p q">What are your specialties? </p>
          <p class="p">Most of my sites are built with Wordpress and Bootstrap. My sweet spot is front end development (HTML, CSS, jQuery). I'm expert at turning a PSD into working&nbsp;code. </p>
        </div><!-- /.qna -->

        <div class="qna">
          <p class="p q">What's your background? </p>
          <p class="p">I grew up in northeastern Vermont (the Northeast Kingdom). After college I had a <span style="white-space: no-wrap;">five-year</span> <span class="nowrap">mini-career</span> in marketing for nonprofits that plan conferences for socially responsible business&nbsp;leaders*. <br />
          <span class="-small">*think: Ben from Ben &amp; Jerry's, Tom from Tom's of Maine </span></p>
          <p class="p">Eventually I was more focused on hacking around on the website and coding the monthly enewsletter than on messaging and branding and other important marketing&nbsp;things. </p>
          <p class="p">Since 2009 I've been a full time freelance <span class="nowrap">programmer-designer-developer</span>, with a short stint in 2010 writing SEO blogs. In January 2016 I incorporated as <a href="http://www.darkblackllc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Erica Dreisbach | Dark Black LLC" class="a">Dark Black LLC</a>. </p>

        <div class="qna">
          <p class="p q">What do you post on Twitter? </p>
          <p class="p">Follow <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ericadreisbach" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="a">@ericadreisbach</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/darkblackllc" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="a">@darkblackllc</a> on Twitter where I post my favorite web design links and resources! Check it out if you're interested. Also, if you follow me on Twitter, then unlike Spinoza's twitter, I will follow you&nbsp;back. </p>
        </div><!-- /.qna -->

        <div class="qna">
          <p class="p q">What's the best way to get in&nbsp;touch? </p>
          <p class="p">I love email. You may have once heard an oracle tell of <span class="nowrap">true-hearted</span> web developers that maintain an empty inbox. I am one such of whom the oracle&nbsp;spake. </p>
          <p class="p">You can expect an email reply within an hour during Central business hours, and usually within more like 20 minutes. I'm also open and flexible about making appointments for <span class="nowrap">real-time&nbsp;conversation.</span> </p>
          <p class="p">My favorite attachments from clients are PDFs and screenshots (jpg or png). My least favorites are Microsoft&nbsp;Word&reg;&nbsp;docx or PowerPoint&reg;&nbsp;pptx. </p>
